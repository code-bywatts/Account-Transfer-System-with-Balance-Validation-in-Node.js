# Account Transfer System with Balance Validation in Node.js by VASU WATTS
Developed a Node.js and Express.js application integrated with MongoDB to simulate a secure bank account transfer system. The project implements an API endpoint that facilitates money transfers between user accounts with strict balance validation to prevent overdrafts. Using Mongoose for database modeling, each account record includes a name and balance field, ensuring accurate transaction handling. The system verifies account existence, checks sufficient balance, and updates both sender and receiver accounts atomically. This project demonstrates structured backend design, data validation, and transaction integrity in financial operations.
